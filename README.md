# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

## Overview
Welcome to this repository! Here, I have performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on different datasets to uncover insights, detect patterns, and visualize key statistics. The goal is to enhance data understanding before applying machine learning models or making data-driven decisions.
The analysis cover:
- Univariate Analysis ðŸ“Š: Examining individual features using histograms, KDE plots, box plots, etc.
- Bivariate Analysis ðŸ”„: Exploring relationships between two variables using scatter plots, bar plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.
- Multivariate Analysis ðŸ“ˆ: Analyzing interactions between multiple variables using pair plots, PCA, and advanced visualizations.

  
## Datasets Used
This repository includes EDA on the following datasets:
- **Diabetes Dataset**: Analyzing the relationship between glucose levels, pregnancies, BMI, and diabetes outcome.
- To be continue

## Key Analyses & Techniques
The EDA process includes:

- **Statistical Summaries**
  - Mean, median, standard deviation, correlations
- **Data Visualization**
  - KDE plots, histograms, box plots, pair plots
  - Heatmaps to show correlations
  - Bar plots to analyze categorical relationships



## Visualizations & Findings
Some key findings from the EDA:
- Higher glucose levels are correlated with a higher probability of diabetes.
- Individuals with more pregnancies tend to have higher glucose levels.
- Certain features exhibit strong relationships, which can help in predictive modeling.
